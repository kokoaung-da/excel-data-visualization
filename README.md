# Excel Data Visualization Practice

This repository showcases my hands-on practice with data visualization techniques in Microsoft Excel.
It includes various custom charts and advanced visualization styles, created to enhance data storytelling and dashboard design skills.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to explore and practice different chart types beyond standard Excel visuals — focusing on creativity, clarity, and analytical impact.
Each visualization is designed using Excel’s native charting tools and enhanced through formatting and layout customization.
